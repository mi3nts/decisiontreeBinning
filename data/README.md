Data is from PhysioNet dataset: EEG During Mental Arithmetic Tasks (https://doi.org/10.13026/C2JQ1P). EEG data were collected monopolarly using the Neurocom EEG 23-channel system (Ukraine, XAI-MEDICA). The electrodes were placed on the scalp according to the International 10/20 montage. The reference electrodes were placed in the ears. A 30 Hz cut-off frequency high-pass filter and a 50 Hz power line notch filter were used. The data are artifact-free segments of 60 seconds. In preprocessing, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to eliminate artifacts (eyes, muscles, and cardiac). 

For this case study, the baseline EEG recording from Subject 00 is used. Occipital electrodes (O1 and O2) are averaged to produce an aggregate occipital EEG signal.
